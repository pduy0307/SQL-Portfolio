Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
Code:
select count(*)
from table
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.
Code:
select count(distinct key) 
from table 

i. Business = 10000 (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id)
v. Review = 10000 (primary key), 9581(user_id), 8090 (business_id),
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id) 
vii. Photo = 10000 (id), 6493 (business_id)
viii. Tip = 537 (user_id), 3979 (business_id)
ix. User = 10000(id), 
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	select count(*)
	from user
	where id IS NULL 
	or name IS NULL
	or review_count IS NULL
	or yelping_since IS NULL
	or useful IS NULL
	or funny IS NULL
	or cool IS NULL

	or compliment_note IS NULL
	or compliment_plain IS NULL
	or compliment_cool IS NULL
	or compliment_funny IS NULL
	or compliment_writer IS NULL
	or compliment_photos IS NULL
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:
Code:
select min(key), max(key), avg(key)
from table

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082	
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1.0	max: 5.0	avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0 		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0		max: 2000	avg: 24.2995

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No, the location data does not provide any conclusion because each distribution rating provide different postal code and neighborhood
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT
       CASE
       WHEN stars>=4 THEN '4-5 Stars'
       WHEN (stars>=2 AND stars<=3) THEN '2-3 Stars'
       END as rating,

       review_count,
       hours.hours,
       name,
       city, category,
       state,
       postal_code


FROM business INNER JOIN category
     ON business.id=category.business_id

     INNER JOIN hours
     ON business.id=hours.business_id

WHERE city='Las Vegas'
      AND category = 'Shopping'
      AND (stars>=4 OR (stars <3 and stars>2))

ORDER BY stars DESC, hours DESC
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: The average stars between ones that are open and closed is 3.67 and 3.52 respectively. 
         
         
ii. Difference 2: The average reviews between ones that are open and closed is 31.75 and 23.19 respectively.
         
+--------------------+-------------------+---------+---------------+
| count(distinct id) | AVG(review_count) | is_open |    AVG(stars) |
+--------------------+-------------------+---------+---------------+
|               1520 |     23.1980263158 |       0 | 3.52039473684 |
|               8480 |     31.7570754717 |       1 | 3.67900943396 |
+--------------------+-------------------+---------+---------------+
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select  count(distinct id),
        AVG(review_count), 
        is_open, 
        AVG(stars)
from business 
group by is_open
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
The analysis is to find out what are the most successful businesses based on the business category.
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
n order to do this analysis, we will need data such as id, stars, and review count from the business table and category from category table. We will need to count the numbers of companies within each category, the average stars given by the consumers to see how they perform, and the total reviews given to see if the data is relevant and ensure itâ€™s not biased.

Lastly, weâ€™re only going to look at categories with at least 10 companies and an average of 3.5+ stars to reduce any irrelevant data.                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
n order to do this analysis, we will need data such as id, stars, and review count from the business table and category from category table. We will need to count the numbers of companies within each category, the average stars given by the consumers to see how they perform, and the total reviews given to see if the data is relevant and ensure itâ€™s not biased.

Lastly, weâ€™re only going to look at categories with at least 10 companies and an average of 3.5+ stars to reduce any irrelevant data.        
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
SELECT  category, 
        count(distinct id) AS num_companies, 
        round(avg(stars),2) AS avg_stars,
        sum(review_count) total_reviews
FROM business
JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id
GROUP BY category
HAVING avg_stars >= 3.5 AND num_companies >= 10
ORDER BY avg_stars DESC
